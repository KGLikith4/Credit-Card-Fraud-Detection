# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on various features like the transaction amount, user ID, and other anonymized data. The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains over 280,000 transactions, with a small percentage of fraudulent ones.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Flask/FastAPI for model deployment
